If you go on Saturday morning, you’ll find local baked goods, cheeses, jams and other treats on the north side farmers’ market.  On the south side (across the street), most of the ready-made foods are on the lower level.  A favourite indulgence is the Italian sandwich – veal, chicken or eggplant.  Also be sure to go to Ace Bakery for a pastry dessert (if they haven’t sold out!)"
