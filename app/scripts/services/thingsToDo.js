It’s just a short ride from the Jack Layton Ferry Terminal at the south end of Bay Street to Centre Island.  Once there, the best way to get away from the crowds (likely if it’s a weekend) is to rent a bicycle – traditional, tandem, or four-seater – and explore.  There are beaches (including one nude beach for the adventurous), nice shady trees for picnics, and a gorgeous view of the Toronto skyline."
